## Code Organization

### Files Modified
- `index.html` - Added HTML structure
- `assets/css/main.css` - Added comprehensive styling
- `assets/js/main.js` - Added JavaScript functionality
- `featured-projects-test.html` - Created dedicated test page
- Created `assets/images/projects/cloud-certification-icon.svg`

### Code Structure
- Modular CSS with BEM methodology
- Reusable JavaScript functions
- Consolidated DOM initialization
- Error handling and fallbacks

## Integration with Existing Code
- Seamlessly integrated with existing design system
- Uses established color variables and typography
- Maintains consistent spacing and layout patterns

## Testing

### Test Page
A dedicated test page has been created for isolated testing of the featured projects section:

**File**: `featured-projects-test.html`

**Purpose**: 
- Provides isolated testing environment for featured projects functionality
- Tests grid layout, styling, and responsive design
- Validates JavaScript functionality without interference from other page elements
- Enables focused debugging and development

**Features**:
- Clean test environment with minimal styling
- Includes only the featured projects section
- Uses same CSS and JavaScript as main site
- Responsive design testing
- Accessibility validation

**Usage**:
```bash
# Open test page in browser
open featured-projects-test.html
# or
python -m http.server 8000
# Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/featured-projects-test.html
```

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test responsive design across devices using the test page
2. Verify all project links work correctly
3. Test hover and focus states in isolation
4. Validate accessibility with screen readers
5. Check performance with multiple projects
6. Test error handling for missing images
7. Use test page for debugging JavaScript functionality
8. Validate grid layout behavior at different screen sizes
