## Changes Made

### Skip Links Comment Update
**File**: `portfolio-website/index.html`
**Line**: 347

**Before:**
```html
<!-- Skip Links for Accessibility -->
```

**After:**
```html
<!-- Skip Links for Accessibility - Hidden until focused -->
```

## Technical Details

### What Are Skip Links?
Skip links are accessibility features that allow keyboard users and screen reader users to quickly navigate to important sections of a webpage without having to tab through all navigation elements.

### Current Implementation
```html
<!-- Skip Links for Accessibility - Hidden until focused -->
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a> 
<a href="#navigation" class="skip-link">Skip to navigation</a> 
```

### Skip Link Behavior
- **Hidden by default**: Skip links are visually hidden using CSS
- **Visible on focus**: When a user tabs to them, they become visible
- **Keyboard accessible**: Users can press Tab to access them and Enter to activate
- **Screen reader friendly**: Screen readers announce these links to users

### CSS Implementation
The skip links are styled with the `.skip-link` class which should include:
```css
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  top: -40px;
  left: 6px;
  background: #000;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 8px;
  text-decoration: none;
  z-index: 1000;
  transition: top 0.3s;
}

.skip-link:focus {
  top: 6px;
}
```

## Benefits

### Accessibility Improvements

## Documentation Enhancement

### Comment Clarity
The updated comment `<!-- Skip Links for Accessibility - Hidden until focused -->` provides better context by explaining:
1. **Purpose**: These are accessibility features
2. **Behavior**: They are hidden until focused
3. **Functionality**: They become visible when users tab to them

### Developer Understanding
This clearer documentation helps developers understand:
- Why these links exist
- How they behave
- When they become visible to users

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Press Tab key when page loads - skip links should appear
2. **Screen Reader**: Use screen reader to verify links are announced
3. **Visual Check**: Ensure links are hidden by default but visible on focus

### Accessibility Testing Tools
- **axe-core**: Automated accessibility testing
- **WAVE**: Web accessibility evaluation
- **Lighthouse**: Accessibility audit in Chrome DevTools

## Best Practices Followed

### WCAG 2.1 Guidelines
- **2.4.1 Bypass Blocks**: Provides mechanism to skip repeated content
- **2.1.1 Keyboard**: All functionality available via keyboard
- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value**: Proper semantic markup

### Implementation Standards
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses proper anchor tags with href attributes
- **Descriptive Text**: Clear, actionable link text
- **Proper Targeting**: Links point to actual page sections with IDs
- **CSS Positioning**: Uses absolute positioning for proper hiding/showing

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Skip Links
Consider adding more skip links for complex pages:
```html
<a href="#search" class="skip-link">Skip to search</a>
<a href="#footer" class="skip-link">Skip to footer</a>
<a href="#sidebar" class="skip-link">Skip to sidebar</a>
```

### Enhanced Styling
