# Accessibility Features Documentation

## Overview

The portfolio website implements comprehensive accessibility features to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and provide an excellent experience for all users, including those using assistive technologies.

## üéØ Key Accessibility Features

### 1. Focus Management System

#### Focus Trapping
- **Purpose**: Keeps keyboard focus within modal dialogs and overlays
- **Implementation**: Advanced focus trap with proper state management
- **Features**:
  - Automatic focus on first interactive element
  - Tab/Shift+Tab navigation cycling within container
  - Focus restoration to previous element when trap is released
  - Escape key support for closing modals

#### Usage Example
```javascript
// Trap focus in a modal
const modal = document.getElementById('my-modal');
trapFocus(modal);

// Release focus trap when modal closes
releaseFocusTrap();
```

#### Focus Trap Functions
- `trapFocus(container)` - Activates focus trap within specified container
- `releaseFocusTrap()` - Releases current focus trap and restores previous focus
- `handleFocusTrap(event)` - Internal handler for tab navigation within trap

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

#### Global Shortcuts
- **Alt + M**: Jump to main content
- **Alt + N**: Jump to navigation
- **Alt + F**: Jump to footer
- **Escape**: Close modals, menus, or clear search
- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate through interactive elements
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate within menus and lists

#### Skip Links (Selective Implementation)
- Available on complex pages like certification roadmap
- Jump to main content, navigation, and footer
- Only visible when focused for clean visual design
- Removed from homepage for simplified interface
- CSS styles preserved for potential restoration

### 3. Screen Reader Support

#### ARIA Live Regions
- Dynamic content announcements
- Status updates and form validation messages
- Non-intrusive notifications for screen reader users

#### Semantic Structure
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1-H6)
- Landmark roles for page sections
- Descriptive labels and instructions
- Alternative text for all images

### 4. Visual Accessibility

#### High Contrast Mode
- Toggle button for enhanced visual contrast
- Improved text visibility and border definition
- Persistent user preference storage
- Accessible color combinations

#### Focus Indicators
- Enhanced focus outlines for keyboard navigation
- Visible focus states for all interactive elements
- Consistent focus styling across components
- Mouse vs keyboard navigation detection

### 5. Form Accessibility

#### Enhanced Form Features
- Proper label associations
- Required field indicators
- Real-time validation with screen reader announcements
- Error message integration with form controls
- Accessible form descriptions and instructions

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Accessibility State Management
```javascript
const accessibilityState = {
    isKeyboardNavigation: false,
    focusedElement: null,
    skipLinksAdded: false,
    ariaLiveRegion: null,
    focusTrap: {
        container: null,
        firstElement: null,
        lastElement: null,
        previousFocus: null
    }
};
```

### Focus Trap Implementation Details

#### Container Selection
The focus trap automatically identifies focusable elements within a container:
- Buttons
- Links with href attributes
- Form inputs (input, select, textarea)
- Elements with tabindex (except tabindex="-1")

#### Navigation Behavior
- **Tab**: Moves to next focusable element, cycles to first when reaching last
- **Shift+Tab**: Moves to previous focusable element, cycles to last when reaching first
- **Escape**: Releases focus trap (when implemented in calling code)

#### State Preservation
- Stores reference to previously focused element
- Automatically restores focus when trap is released
- Maintains focus trap state for proper cleanup

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when elements are not found
- Safe focus restoration with existence checks
- Non-blocking implementation that doesn't break page functionality

## üß™ Testing Accessibility

### Manual Testing
1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Tab through all interactive elements
   - Verify focus indicators are visible
   - Test skip links functionality
   - Confirm modal focus trapping works

2. **Screen Reader Testing**
   - Test with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
   - Verify announcements for dynamic content
   - Check heading structure and landmarks
   - Validate form accessibility

3. **Visual Testing**
   - Test high contrast mode
   - Verify color contrast ratios
   - Check focus visibility
   - Test at different zoom levels

### Automated Testing Tools
- **axe-core**: Accessibility testing library
- **Lighthouse**: Built-in accessibility audit
- **WAVE**: Web accessibility evaluation tool
- **Pa11y**: Command-line accessibility testing

## üé® Styling Considerations

### CSS Classes
- `.sr-only`: Screen reader only content
- `.sr-only-focusable`: Focusable screen reader content
- `.keyboard-navigation`: Applied when keyboard navigation is detected
- `.high-contrast`: Applied when high contrast mode is enabled

### Focus Styles
```css
.keyboard-navigation *:focus {
    outline: 2px solid #0066cc;
    outline-offset: 2px;
}

.keyboard-navigation button:focus,
.keyboard-navigation input:focus {
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(0, 102, 204, 0.2);
}
```

## üöÄ Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

#### Implementing Focus Traps
```javascript
// When opening a modal
function openModal(modalId) {
    const modal = document.getElementById(modalId);
    modal.classList.add('modal--open');
    trapFocus(modal);
}

// When closing a modal
function closeModal() {
    releaseFocusTrap();
    document.querySelector('.modal--open').classList.remove('modal--open');
}
```

#### Adding Announcements
```javascript
// Announce status changes
announceToScreenReader('Form submitted successfully');

// Announce errors with higher priority
announceToScreenReader('Error: Please fill in required fields', 'assertive');
```

### Best Practices
1. Always provide focus traps for modal dialogs
2. Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
3. Use semantic HTML elements when possible
4. Provide alternative text for images
5. Test with actual assistive technologies
6. Maintain consistent navigation patterns

## üìù Recent Changes

### February 2025 - Skip Links Removal
- **Homepage Update**: Removed skip links from `index.html` for cleaner design
- **Selective Implementation**: Skip links remain on complex pages (certification roadmap)
- **CSS Preservation**: All skip link styles preserved in `assets/css/accessibility.css`
- **Alternative Navigation**: Tab navigation and semantic HTML structure maintained
- **Accessibility Impact**: Trade-off between clean design and keyboard shortcuts
- **Testing Updates**: Production test instructions updated to focus on general keyboard navigation

### Rationale
- Modern web design trend toward cleaner interfaces
- Semantic HTML and proper heading hierarchy provide alternative navigation
- Skip links can be easily restored if user feedback indicates need
- Focus remains on comprehensive accessibility through other methods
- Testing approach updated to reflect current implementation

### Testing Impact
- **Production Tests**: Updated to focus on general keyboard navigation
- **Accessibility Validation**: Emphasizes Tab navigation through all interactive elements
- **User Experience**: Maintains accessibility standards without skip link dependency
