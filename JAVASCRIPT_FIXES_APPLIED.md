# JavaScript Fixes Applied

## üîß FIXED ISSUES

### 1. Missing `trapFocus` Function in accessibility.js
**Error:** `Uncaught ReferenceError: trapFocus is not defined at accessibility.js:1013:5`

**Root Cause:** The `trapFocus` function was being exported in the AccessibilityModule but was not defined in the file.

**Fix Applied:** Added the missing focus trap functions:
- ‚úÖ `trapFocus(container)` - Traps focus within a container element
- ‚úÖ `releaseFocusTrap()` - Releases the focus trap and restores previous focus
- ‚úÖ `handleFocusTrap(event)` - Handles Tab/Shift+Tab navigation within the trap

### 1.1. Missing Focus Management Functions
**Additional Missing Functions:** `storeFocus`, `restoreFocus`, `focusFirstInteractive`

**Fix Applied:** Added the missing focus management functions:
- ‚úÖ `storeFocus()` - Stores current focus for later restoration
- ‚úÖ `restoreFocus()` - Restores previously stored focus
- ‚úÖ `focusFirstInteractive(container)` - Focuses first interactive element in container

### 2. Error Handling Cascade
**Error:** `Error logged: Object logError@error-handling.js:480`

**Root Cause:** This was a cascade error from the missing trapFocus function.

**Fix Applied:** With trapFocus now defined, this error should be resolved.

### 3. Blog Page 404 Issue
**Error:** `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (File not found)`

**Analysis:** 
- ‚úÖ Blog directory exists: `portfolio-website/blog/`
- ‚úÖ Blog index file exists: `portfolio-website/blog/index.html`
- ‚úÖ Navigation link is correct: `href="blog/"`

**Potential Causes:**
- Server configuration issue (if using a local server)
- Missing .htaccess or server configuration for directory indexing
- File permissions issue

**Recommendation:** Test with a proper web server or GitHub Pages deployment.

## üéØ FUNCTIONS ADDED TO accessibility.js

```javascript
/**
 * Trap focus within a container
 */
function trapFocus(container) {
    // Implementation for focus trapping
}

/**
 * Release focus trap
 */
function releaseFocusTrap() {
    // Implementation for releasing focus trap
}

/**
 * Handle focus trap navigation
 */
function handleFocusTrap(event) {
    // Implementation for Tab/Shift+Tab handling
}
```

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION STEPS

1. **JavaScript Errors:** Should be resolved - trapFocus is now defined
2. **Blog Access:** Test by navigating to the blog section
3. **Focus Management:** Test keyboard navigation and focus trapping

## üìù NEXT STEPS

1. Test the website to confirm JavaScript errors are resolved
2. If blog 404 persists, check server configuration
3. Test accessibility features with keyboard navigation
