        </div>
        <button class="nav__toggle" aria-label="Toggle navigation menu" aria-expanded="false"
            aria-controls="nav-menu">
            <span class="nav__hamburger"></span>
        </button>
        <ul class="nav__menu" id="nav-menu" role="menubar">
            <li class="nav__item" role="none">
                <a href="index.html" class="nav__link" role="menuitem">Home</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav__item" role="none">
                <a href="projects.html" class="nav__link" role="menuitem">Projects</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav__item" role="none">
                <a href="contact.html" class="nav__link" role="menuitem">Contact</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>
```

#### Styling with CSS

Kiro can help you implement modern CSS techniques:

```
"Create a responsive grid layout for my projects section using CSS Grid"
```

Kiro will generate optimized CSS:

```css
.projects-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    gap: 2rem;
    padding: 1rem;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .projects-grid {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    }
}
```

#### Adding Interactivity with JavaScript

Need to add form validation or interactive elements? Just ask Kiro:

```
"Add form validation to my contact form that checks for valid email format"
```

Kiro will provide the necessary JavaScript:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const contactForm = document.getElementById('contact-form');
    const emailInput = document.getElementById('email');
    const emailError = document.getElementById('email-error');
    
    contactForm.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
        const emailPattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
        if (!emailPattern.test(emailInput.value)) {
            e.preventDefault();
            emailError.textContent = 'Please enter a valid email address';
            emailInput.classList.add('form__input--error');
        }
    });
    
    emailInput.addEventListener('input', () => {
        emailError.textContent = '';
        emailInput.classList.remove('form__input--error');
    });
});
```

## Advanced Features with Kiro

Kiro will generate comprehensive meta tags:

```html
<!-- Primary Meta Tags -->
<title>Your Name | Web Developer & Designer</title>
<meta name="title" content="Your Name | Web Developer & Designer">
<meta name="description" content="Professional web developer specializing in responsive design, JavaScript frameworks, and user experience.">
<meta name="keywords" content="web developer, frontend developer, portfolio, projects">
<meta name="author" content="Your Name">

<!-- Open Graph / Facebook -->
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://yourwebsite.com/">
<meta property="og:title" content="Your Name | Web Developer & Designer">
<meta property="og:description" content="Professional web developer specializing in responsive design, JavaScript frameworks, and user experience.">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://yourwebsite.com/assets/images/og-image.jpg">
```

### Form Integration

Need to set up a contact form without a backend? Kiro can help integrate with services like Formspree:

```
"Set up my contact form to work with Formspree"
```

Kiro will provide the necessary configuration:

```html
<form class="contact-form" id="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/your-formspree-id" method="POST">
    <!-- Formspree Configuration -->
    <input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="New Portfolio Contact Form Submission">

    <input type="hidden" name="_captcha" value="false">
    <input type="text" name="_gotcha" style="display:none">
    
    <!-- Form fields -->
</form>
```

### Performance Optimization

Kiro can analyze your website and suggest performance improvements:

```
"Check my website for performance issues"
```

Kiro might suggest:

```
I've analyzed your website and found some performance opportunities:

1. Images need optimization - I can help compress them without quality loss
2. JavaScript files should be deferred to improve loading time
3. Consider implementing lazy loading for images below the fold
4. Add browser caching headers for static assets

Would you like me to implement these changes?
```

```

Kiro will guide you through the process:

1. Creating a GitHub repository
2. Setting up GitHub Actions for automated deployment
3. Configuring custom domains if needed
4. Ensuring all links work correctly in the production environment

## Real-World Example: Building a Contact Page

Let's see how Kiro can help build a complete contact page:

```
"Create a contact page with a form that includes name, email, subject, and message fields, plus social media links"
```

Kiro will generate a comprehensive solution with:

1. Semantic HTML structure
2. Form validation
3. Success and error messages
4. Responsive design
5. Accessibility features
6. Social media integration

## Best Practices Enforced by Kiro

When working with Kiro on web development projects, you'll automatically follow industry best practices:

1. **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of HTML5 elements for better accessibility and SEO
2. **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive layouts that work on all devices
3. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient code and optimized assets
4. **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG standards implementation
5. **SEO Best Practices**: Proper meta tags and structured data
6. **Clean Code Architecture**: Well-organized, maintainable code structure

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

One of Kiro's most powerful features for web development is its Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, which extends Kiro's capabilities through specialized tools:

### What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows Kiro to connect with external tools and services, expanding its capabilities beyond the core IDE functionality. For web development, this means access to specialized tools for:

- Documentation search and retrieval
- Performance testing
- Accessibility validation
- SEO analysis
- Image optimization
- API integration

### AWS Documentation Integration

When building websites that integrate with AWS services (like S3 for storage or Lambda for serverless functions), Kiro's MCP integration provides direct access to AWS documentation:

```
"How do I configure CORS for an S3 bucket that hosts my website assets?"
```

Kiro can search, retrieve, and explain AWS documentation directly in your workflow, without requiring you to switch contexts or search manually.

### Configuring MCP for Web Development

Kiro allows you to configure MCP servers at both workspace and user levels:

- **Workspace Level**: Configure project-specific tools in `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`
- **User Level**: Set up global tools in `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`

For web development, useful MCP configurations might include:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "web-performance": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["web-performance-analyzer@latest"],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": ["analyze-page-speed", "suggest-optimizations"]
    },
    "accessibility-checker": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["accessibility-validator@latest"],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": ["check-wcag-compliance"]
    }
  }
}
```
