# 🚀 Complete GitHub Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through uploading your portfolio website to GitHub and making it live with GitHub Pages.

## 📋 What You'll Need

- GitHub account (free)
- Git installed on your computer
- Your portfolio website files (already ready!)

## 🎯 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Repository name options:**
   - **Option A:** `your-username.github.io` (recommended for personal portfolio)
   - **Option B:** `portfolio-website` or any name you prefer
5. **Make it Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
6. **Don't check** "Add a README file" (we already have one)
7. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Upload Your Files

**Option A: Using Git Commands (Recommended)**

Open terminal/command prompt in your `portfolio-website` folder:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial portfolio website"

# Connect to your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git

# Upload to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Option B: Using GitHub Desktop (Easier)**

1. Download and install GitHub Desktop
2. Click "Add an Existing Repository from your Hard Drive"
3. Select your `portfolio-website` folder
4. Click "Publish repository"
5. Choose your repository name and make it public

**Option C: Upload via Web Interface**

1. Go to your empty repository on GitHub
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag and drop all your portfolio files
4. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub
2. **Click "Settings"** tab
3. **Scroll to "Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. **Under "Source":**
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch
   - Select "/ (root)" folder
5. **Click "Save"**

### Step 4: Get Your Live URL

GitHub will show you the URL where your site will be available:

- **If repository name is `your-username.github.io`:**
  - URL: `https://your-username.github.io`
  
- **If repository name is something else:**
  - URL: `https://your-username.github.io/repository-name`

**Wait 5-10 minutes** for the site to build and become available.

## 🛠️ Using the Deployment Scripts

I've created deployment scripts to make updates easier:

### Windows Users:
```cmd
# Double-click deploy.bat or run in command prompt:
deploy.bat
```

### Mac/Linux Users:
```bash
# Make script executable (first time only):
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Run the script:
./deploy.sh
```

## 🔧 Updating Your Website

After making changes to your website:

```bash
# Add changes
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Update portfolio content"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

Your live website will update automatically within a few minutes!

## 🌐 Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

If you have your own domain (like `yourname.com`):

### Step 1: Add CNAME File
I've already created a `CNAME` file with `dineshrajdhanapathy.dev`. Update it with your domain:

```
your-domain.com
```

### Step 2: Configure DNS
In your domain provider's settings, add:
- **CNAME record:** `www` pointing to `your-username.github.io`
- **A records:** `@` pointing to:
  - `185.199.108.153`
  - `185.199.109.153`
  - `185.199.110.153`
  - `185.199.111.153`

### Step 3: Enable HTTPS
In GitHub Pages settings, check "Enforce HTTPS"

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**❌ 404 Error**
- Check that `index.html` is in the root directory
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings > Pages

**❌ CSS/Images Not Loading**
- Ensure all file paths are relative (no leading `/`)
- Check that files are committed and pushed to GitHub

**❌ Blog Not Working**
- Verify `blog/index.html` exists
- Check that blog posts are in `blog/posts/`

**❌ Permission Denied**
- Make sure repository is public
- Check that you have push access to the repository

### File Structure Verification:
```
portfolio-website/
├── index.html              ✅ Homepage
├── projects.html           ✅ Projects page
